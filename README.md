# WEEK-12-REVIEW

### Using Bcrypt to Hash Paawords

* Using BCrypt to hash passwords came from the idea of thinking about how to protect user information
in the worst case scenario

### What is cryptography

* cryptography is a way to use algos and secret keys to keep information secure

* adversaries are third-parties who could possibly fake a user's identity to gain their secret value

* encoding and encrytion are two different processes
(ex. encoding for compressing aaacccbbb a3b3c3, for highly repetitive code)

* encryption is the process of translating something readable into something that looks like nonsense
and being able to translate it from a non-readible state back into something that's readable
